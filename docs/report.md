# Py Sensor Display

Professor Michmerhuizen,

Below is the report regarding the project proposal described in this [document]{https://github.com/tjdevries/py_sensor_display/blob/master/docs/proposal.md}. This report was created in response to the final project for the Engineering 325 Lab. This report was created by TJ DeVries and Ryan Siekman.

## Goals of the project

Ryan and I set out to create a basic example of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) for our Senior Design project. This design must create the framework for a gym reservation system. The View portion must incorporate elements of GTK, which neither Ryan nor TJ have had experience on previously. The system must be light enough to run off of a Raspberry Pi. 

This MVC must be capable of taking in machine specifications, such as type (treadmill versus bicycle), status (open versus reserved), location in the gym and an identification number (ID). Once an input has been given to the machine, through the use of a GTK graphical user interface (GUI), the user should be able to see the status of all the machines. This status should be displayed in such a way that the average user can easily determine where a machine is located in the gym.

## Resources Used

The resources can be categorized primarily in two ways. The first are software tools. The team used Git to collaborate and work on separate features of the project simultaneously. Additionally, the team used Python 3.4 and its built-in libraries to design and create the project. 

The second category are hardware tools. This is the Raspberry Pi that the team showed the project could be run on. However, the implementation is quite platform agnostic and will work on a wide range of machines, provided that machine has a working Python 3.4 interpreter.
