# Proposal

Professor Michmerhuizen,

TJ DeVries and Ryan Siekman propose for the **Final Lab Design Project** to work on a Model-View-Controller application that will handle the sensor data sent to the hub for Team 14's Sensible Gym Design. 

### Overview

This Model-View-Controller application will be written in Python and will be capable of taking in updates to current use of machines and display their status in a graphical fashion. The main goal would be to have machines be laid out in a similar way that they are laid out in the gym, placed or configured by someone before the model is run, and then display them accordingly.

### Requirements

To meet the requirements, our project will:

  1. Have only two persons working on the team: Ryan and TJ
  2. The project is being proposed before the end of Lab on November 19, and the breakdown is described below
  3. The project will run on a Raspberry Pi and will utilize GTK, a library Ryan and TJ have not used before
  4. The project is tied to the senior design project
  5. The scope appears to be approriate for the size of the team.

### Breakdown of Tasks

- Ryan:
  - Design the Model part of the MVC
  - Work on connecting API for each of the sections
- TJ:
  - Design the View & Controller 
  - Work on connecting API for each of the sections

From,

TJ & Ryan
